# YourNetworkAPI

This API was created for a social network application using express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. This was created to have users share their thoughts, react to their friend's thoughts and for users to be able to create a friend's list through CRUD operation. This project allowed me understand and use MongoDB and Mongoose at a closer level.
